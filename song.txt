[Intro]
Say goodnight and go
(Woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 1]
Skipping beats, blushing cheeks, I am struggling
Daydreaming, bed scenes in the corner caf√©
And then I'm left in bits, recovering tectonic tremblings
You get me every time

[Chorus]
Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go
(Woah, woah, woah)
