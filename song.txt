[Intro]
Say goodnight and go
(Woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 1]
Skipping beats, blushing cheeks, I am struggling
Daydreaming, bed scenes in the corner caf√©
And then I'm left in bits, recovering tectonic tremblings
You get me every time

[Chorus]
Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go
(Woah, woah, woah)

[Verse 2]
Follow you home, you've got your headphones on and you're dancing (Dancing)
Got lucky, beautiful shot, you're taking everything off
Watch the curtains wide open
And you fall in the same routine, flicking through the TV
Relaxed and reclining (Reclining)
And you think you're alone

[Chorus]
Oh, why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

[Bridge]
One of these days, you'll miss your train and come stay with me (It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
You'd sleep here, I'd sleep there, but then the heating may be down again (At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

[Interlude]
Go

[Chorus]
Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

[Outro]
Oh
Why's it always, always
Goodnight and go
Oh, darling, not again
Goodnight and
Go
